        <h2>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m Preetham, a graduate in Information Science & Engineering from NMAMIT, Nitte. Driven by a deep interest in engineering, I chose this field to explore innovative solutions and address real-world problems.
		Over the course of my 4-year program, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience by building several tech projects that reflect my curiosity and commitment to learning.
		My academic journey began at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV), Shimoga, where I completed both my secondary and higher secondary education. More than academics, JNV instilled in me values that I believe are foundational to personal and professional success â€” integrity, compassion, empathy, patience, and leadership.
		I believe these human qualities matter just as much â€” if not more â€” than technical skills, which anyone can learn over time, but character is built through experience.
